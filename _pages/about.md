Pursuing Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in the Department of Energy Research (formerly Interdisciplinary Centre for Energy Research (ICER)), Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore, INDIA, under the guidance of Prof L. Umanand and Dr. Subba Reddy B. 

My current research is centered on developing a decentralized hybrid source thermal desalination system that efficiently utilizes latent heat. This system is integrated with a Photovoltaic (PV) system through a DC-DC converter and a Battery Management System (BMS). 

My current research encompasses both fundamental and applied sciences. 1) on the fundamental science where I study the thermal, mechanical, electromagnetic, and electrothermal energy conversion process for designing and developing the hybrid source thermal desalination system through multi-physics and bond modelling. 2) on applied science where I investigate and evaluate performance, and efficiency of the system including technoeconomic analysis. Assess social and environmental constraints to ensure the system's viability for real-world application and implementation. 

Experience in designing and experimentally evaluating multilevel inverter and dc-dc converter. 

Areas of research interest are power electronics for renewable energy conversion (specifically dc-dc converter and MPPT), Bond graph modelling of physical systems, application of thermoelectric modules for energy harvesting and hybrid PVT systems, thermal desalination with interfacial heat localization, Decarbonisation
